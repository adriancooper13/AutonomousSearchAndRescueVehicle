# Autonomous Search and Rescue Vehicle

The goal of this project is to build an autonomous vehicle that can locate and retrieve golf balls in a designated area. Our team is comprised of two Computer Science students:
- Adrian Cooper
- Phillip Mitchell

and four Mechanical Engineering students:
- Matt Albro
- Alvaro Jara
- Christopher Brockish
- Buddhi Jayaweera

The computer science team was responsible for writing the software to allow the vehicle to pick up and retrieve as many golf balls as possible within 15 minutes. The mechanical engineering team was responsible for building the vehicle.

Some rules and field specs we were given:
- The area will be a 75x75 foot grass field located on the UCF campus next to the football field.
- The drop-off zone will be a 10x10 foot area in one corner of the field.
- There will be no obsticles or items to avoid picking up within the field. Only white golf balls.
- We are allowed to use manual control for up to 30 seconds at a time, but afterward a cooldown period of 30 seconds is required.
- The team has been given a budget of $600. The idea is to have $300 for each subteam (CS and ME), but ultimately it is up to the team to decide how to use the money.
